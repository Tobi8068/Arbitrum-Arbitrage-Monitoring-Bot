Implementation Strategy
Since your project has several components that need to work together seamlessly, I recommend implementing it in phases:
Phase 1: Infrastructure
1.	Set up the Rust project structure
2.	Implement IPC communication with the Arbitrum node
3.	Establish WebSocket connections and verify data flow
4.	Implement the in-memory database for liquidity storage
Phase 2: Core Functionality
5.	Implement basic scanner engine
6.	Add exchange-specific price and liquidity calculations
7.	Implement liquidity tier and profitability logic
8.	Create the IPC bridge to the execution bot
Phase 3: Optimization and Testing
9.	Optimize WebSocket processing for minimal latency
10.	Implement comprehensive test suite
11.	Add performance metrics and monitoring
12.	Fine-tune thresholds and parameters
Key Rust-Specific Design Considerations
1.	Concurrency Model: Use Tokio's async/await for concurrency, with carefully designed task boundaries to maximize throughput.
2.	Memory Management: Utilize Rust's ownership model to eliminate data races while minimizing copying. Use Arc/Mutex where shared ownership is needed.
3.	Error Handling: Implement custom error types with context information for robust error handling and debugging.
4.	Zero-Copy Deserialization: When possible, use zero-copy deserialization for WebSocket data to minimize latency.
5.	Channels: Use Tokio's MPSC channels for communication between components, with appropriate buffer sizes to handle bursts of activity.
6.	Shared Memory: Implement efficient IPC using shared memory with appropriate synchronization primitives.
